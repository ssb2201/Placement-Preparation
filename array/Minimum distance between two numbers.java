Minimum distance between two numbers
You are given an array A, of N elements. You need to find minimum distance between given two integers x and y.

Distance: The distance (index-based) between two elements of the array.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting size array. Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array A. The last line of each test case contains two integers  x and y.

Output Format:
For each test case, print the required answer .

Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function minDist which returns  an integer denoting the minimum distance between two integers x and y in the array. If no such distance is possible then return -1.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A, x, y <= 105

Example:
Input:
2
4
1 2 3 2
1 2
7
86 39 90 67 84 66 62 
42 12
Output:
1
-1

Explanation:
Testcase1: x = 1 and y = 2. There are two distances between x and y, which are 1 and 3 out of which the minDistance between x and y is 1.
Testcase2: x = 42 and y = 12. We return -1 as the x and y don't exist in the array.
